Traffic Jam is a navigation application with some additional features that revolve around travelling to Pennovation Center for our coding bootcamp.
It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, embedded objects (iframes) and several API calls.

On loading, the user is met with our header w/ logo and an empty form. Filling out this form with a location or address allows the user to generate a Google Maps result for direction from their input to Pennovation.

After clicking the search button, several fields are populated on the page. The Google Maps w/ direction appears along with some weather items and an embedded Spotify player.
Maps functions how you would expect, nothing deviant here.
The page renders the current weather conditions in Philadelphia, with descriptive text on how to prepare for said weather. Below this section is a 5-day forecast for Philadelphia.
At the bottom of the application is an embedded Spotify playlist with all driving themed songs, as this felt most fitting.
